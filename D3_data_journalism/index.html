          <h2>Correlations Between Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Research has shown a link between
            poverty and poor health. People with
            more income tend to be healthier and
            live longer. What explains the connection? Many factors.</p>

            <p>For one, lack of care. We know that
            18.5% of the U.S. non-elderly population does not have health insurance,
            with low-income families especially
            vulnerable to being uninsured.</p>
            
            <p>Nearly 70% of the uninsured population is poor or near-poor. The uninsured
            tend to forego preventative care and
            to wait until an illness is severe before
            seeking medical care.</p>
            
            <p>The proportion of poor children not receiving any health care in a given year
            is twice that of higher-income children.
            Another reason poverty affects health is
            that it often exposes people to unfavorable living and workplace conditions,
            stress, and pollution that affect health
            across the life course, starting in utero.</p>

            <p>Brain science and developmental psychology studies suggest
            that the negative effects of early childhood poverty, from prenatal to age 5, might be especially harmful and long lasting.
            This is likely because the brain grows and changes rapidly
            during the first few years of life.</p>
